This model uses a keras LSTM model to train on ten indicators' data and predict future short rates. 

LSTM is chosen because of its ability to learn patterns through time series data

However the result was not very helpful nor meaningful

I will update it if any future analysis is done 

## to run the project
`python predict.py`

a graph of prediction with some previous groundtruth interest rates will appear
